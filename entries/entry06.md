### Expo Elevator Pitch
One takeaway we had from this expo was that many students have suggested us to either adding more levels to our game or increasing the difficulty by adding a movement for our enemy sprite. Another takeaway was to add a prize section at the end based on the amount of coins the player collected because that would've been more interesting where everyone would want to see the prize.

### In-Class Presentation
One takeaway we had from this presentation was that our hook could've been more unique and effective. Another takeaway was making sure that we are intentional about making eye contact with the students in the room. Overall, I think we did a great job with showing our project, going through our processes and explanations.

### Engineering Design Process + Skills
We have finished with our presentations and showed our games to other students and judges. Now, we are on the last step of the Engineering Design Process which is <strong>communicating the results.</strong> Throughout the previous week, we have been given lots of feedbacks on what we did well and how else can we improve. Throughout this process, I have improved a lot on the skills of <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>communication</strong>. Me and my partner had to split our presentations and decide on who to say what. We've also improved on comunication skills becasue we had to present our projects to a wide range of the community.
