# Changing + Tinkering New Tool
##### 12/12/2022

After tinkering with [threejs](https://threejs.org/), I realized that this tool isn't really the best for the game I wanted to make since it is best use for making 3D models or buildings. For me, I wanted to make a game where there is a player and it can move around. Therefore, I closely look through the [tool list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/preview) again and tinkered a little through each of these tools. Then, I realized that [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) is a better choice for me to use because I can use this library to simplify creating scenes, adding layers, creating sprites, dealing with actions and collisions, adding key events, and much more others. 

I am currently on stage 4 and 5 of the EDP (Engineering Design Process) where the main goal is to plan the most promising solution and create a prototype. To plan the most precising solution, I was tinkering with tools to see which one is the best to use for my game that I wanted to make. After deciding and locking a tool, in this case Kaboom, I started to create a small mini project using this tool which can also be known as creating a prototype. Throughtout weeks of researching and tinkering, I have improved on many of the skills. The most important skill I had improved on was collaboration and communication. Due to the fact that the previous tool me and my partner chose weren't the best one for us to use, we had to communicate with each other, thinking about whether or not we should change our tool, and if yes, change to what tool?
