# Working Towards MVP
##### 03/13/2023

### Content 
During the past few weeks, me and my partner have started working towards our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

#### 02/27/2023 - 03/13/2023
Following the steps on our [MVP plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szrDrbG5V1n9tMBLlT8e83kK7NH4SLwHRD-YPeLCInE/edit), we have decided on how our sprites will look like and have been making our sprites using [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/).

* Main Character (Koala)
* Enemy (Owl)
* Obstacles that blocks the character
* Key
* Door
* Coin
