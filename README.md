# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Vicky Zheng

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about using knowledge from Javascript units and making something functional, creating an interactive program using Javascript library, frameworks, etc. The purpose of this blog is to summarize the purpose of Freedom Project and go through the process of making the project. Students also include their challenges, how they overcome them, and what skills have they improved on throughout each process. 

## Content
For my project, I am making an interactive game where the player would has to collect the key and entering the next level by successfully avoid all the enemies. This blog will walk through my process of independently tinkering with this tool called [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) while making my interactive game.

## Implications
My interactive game has impacted all people over the world globally, socially, and economically. There are several positive and negative implications. For example, it can have a significant positive impact where it has the ability to bring people together. This allows people from all over the world to connect and interact which can be helpful in increasing one's relationships between each other. My game is available online where everyone can have access to it. My game would also increase job opportunities and serve as a way to earn money for ones who majors in software engineering, making games. It can be used as an example or to inspire others in making their own games and improve brain function. However, people would get addicted in playing games too often. Excessive gaming would lead to poor emotional regulation and would have an negative impact on one's health. Video game habits would also affect school performancesand have more destructive behaviors such as arguing and fighting with parents and teachers.
